## Why OpenMesh?
Because Meshtastic is cool but my wallet is not.

## Does this support GPS?
No.
If you need satellites to say "OTW", rethink your life choices.

## Is this secure?
Enough for chatting.
Not enough for planning a coup.

### Why Arduino and not ESP-IDF?
Because this project is for humans.

### Will this replace Meshtastic?
No. It replaces *your suffering*.
