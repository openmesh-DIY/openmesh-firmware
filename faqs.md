# OpenMesh FAQ 😈

## Why OpenMesh?
Because Meshtastic is cool but my wallet is not.

Also because:
- DIY hardware deserves respect
- Not everyone wants a $50 dev board
- I like controlling my own stuff

---

## Is this a Meshtastic clone?
No.

Meshtastic is a full ecosystem.
OpenMesh is a **firmware**.

Think:
- Meshtastic = Swiss Army Knife
- OpenMesh = Sharp rock that works

---

## Does this support GPS?
No.

If you need satellites to say “OTW”,
rethink your life choices.

---

## Does this support internet?
Also no.

If your mesh needs WiFi to work,
it’s not a mesh, it’s a dependency issue.

---

## Is this secure?
Enough for chatting.
Not enough for planning a coup.

AES-256 is used, but:
- Key management is manual
- No fancy crypto handshakes
- No illusions of perfection

This is radio, not Fort Knox.

---

## Why Arduino and not ESP-IDF?
Because this project is for humans.

Arduino means:
- Faster onboarding
- Less pain
- More contributors
- Less gatekeeping

ESP-IDF enjoyers are welcome,
but please don’t rewrite everything.

---

## Will this replace Meshtastic?
No.

It replaces *your suffering*.

---

## What hardware does this support?
Currently:
- ESP32
- SX1276 / SX1278
- SSD1306 OLED

More boards may come later.
Or not.
Depends on motivation and coffee.

---

## Why is the UI so simple?
Because:
- OLEDs are tiny
- One button is enough
- Simple UIs don’t crash

Also it looks cool.

---

## Why no delivery confirmation?
Because radio.

If you want guaranteed delivery:
- Use the internet
- Or shout louder

---

## Is this beginner-friendly?
Yes.

If you can:
- Flash an ESP32
- Wire 6 pins
- Read basic code

You’re good.

---

## Can I sell devices running OpenMesh?
Depends on the license.

Check the LICENSE file.
Read it.
Seriously.

---

## Can I contribute?
Yes.

But:
- Keep it simple
- Document your changes
- Don’t break DIY users
- Don’t remove jokes

---

## Why is the maintainer like this?
Unknown.
Probably lack of sleep.

---

## Final Answer
OpenMesh exists because someone needed it.

That someone was broke.
