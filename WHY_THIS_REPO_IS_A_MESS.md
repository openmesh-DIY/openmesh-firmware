# Why This Repo Is a Mess

Short answer: because reality.

Long answer:

- I am one person
- I am broke
- I am tired
- This was built with real hardware, not vibes
- It works, and touching it may anger the radio gods

---

## Important Context

This project was developed:
- Without a team
- Without funding
- Without corporate roadmaps
- Without time to bikeshed folder names

What you see is:
- The fastest path from idea → working mesh
- A repository shaped by survival, not aesthetics

---

## If You Want It Cleaner

You have options:

1. Open a PR  
2. Improve documentation  
3. Refactor something **without breaking it**
4. Accept the chaos

---

## If You Don’t Want To Do Any Of That

You may:
- Cry quietly
- Fork it
- Or simply close the tab and find peace

---

## Final Note

Messy code that works beats clean code that doesn’t.
