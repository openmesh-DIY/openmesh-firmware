Why This Repo Is a Mess
Short answer: because reality hit first.
Long answer: sit down.
The Honest Reasons
I am one person
I am broke
I am tired
I debug at hours where logic goes to sleep
This was built with real hardware, not Figma diagrams and optimism
It works, and touching it without understanding may anger the radio gods
This repo was not born in a sprint. It was born in late nights, bad coffee, and “why is this pin floating” moments.
Important Context (Read Before Judging)
This project was developed:
Without a team
Without funding
Without corporate roadmaps
Without project managers asking for Jira tickets
Without time to bikeshed folder names or argue about tabs vs spaces
What you are looking at is:
The fastest path from idea → working mesh
Code written to survive hardware, not impress GitHub
A repository shaped by necessity, not aesthetics
If something looks weird:
It probably failed once already
And this was the version that didn’t catch fire
About the Code Structure
Yes, some things are ugly.
Yes, some things could be “cleaned up”.
They were left this way because:
They work
They are debuggable
They do not lie to you when they fail
Clean abstractions are great. Clean abstractions that hide RF bugs are not.
If You Want It Cleaner
You have options. Real ones.
Open a PR
Improve documentation
Refactor something without breaking it
Reduce complexity instead of adding layers
Accept the chaos
Bonus points if:
You tested it on actual hardware
You didn’t “rewrite everything”
You kept the jokes
If You Don’t Want To Do Any Of That
That’s also fine.
You may:
Cry quietly
Fork it
Rewrite it “properly”
Or simply close the tab and find peace
Not every repo is meant to spark joy. Some are meant to transmit packets.
A Gentle Warning to Perfectionists
This project values:
Working radios
Predictable behavior
Honest failure modes
Over:
Pretty graphs
Overengineering
Frameworks that exist “just in case”
If your first instinct is:
“This should be rewritten”
Please pause. That instinct has already been rejected by reality.
Final Note
Messy code that works
beats
clean code that doesn’t
every single time.
OpenMesh exists because someone needed it to work.
That someone was tired.
That someone was broke.
And somehow, it still works.
